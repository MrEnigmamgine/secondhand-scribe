# Secondhand Scribe

Secondhand Scribe is a tool to help DMs and players take notes for their TTRPG campaigns.

It works by processing audio recordings of your sessions. Using AI to transcribe your voices into text, it then employs a number of natural language processing techniques to extract useful summaries and notes about your session.

## Work in Progress
The project is a work in progress and is not yet in a usable state.  I am currently researching solutions to the following problems:
- Speaker identification
- Fine-tuning ASR models to better recognize uncommon words and improve transcription accuracy for specific speakers.

If you'd like to follow the progress of my research I invite you to the speghetti-code [hosted here](https://github.com/MrEnigmamgine/Audacle)
